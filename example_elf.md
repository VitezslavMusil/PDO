# Making and Elf deck

This example guides you through making an Elf tribal with [Lathril, Blade of the Elves](https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/242/lathril-blade-of-the-elves) in the command zone.
Various methods for card manipulation will be used with the resulting decklist availible [here](https://archidekt.com/decks/12532933/lahtril_blade_of_the_elves_pdo)
