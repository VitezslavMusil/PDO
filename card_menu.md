## Card options
 - **Printing** - Currently used version of a certain card, complete with colector's number and a preview on the left side
 - **Categories** - Categories for which the card is considered. On default, each card has one automatic category that is being assigned by Archidekt. This allows smoothing of percentages and a more detailed overview of the deck provided ou assign multiple categories to a certain card (e.g. [Sublime Epihany](https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/167/sublime-epiphany) being removal, card draw, bounce and a clone).
 - **All printings** - Displays all availible version of a certain card, allowing for easy choice of the version you like/have

 ### Other options
  - **Color tags** - The color tag a certain card will have. Those can be used for marking card you own, do not have, have ordered etc.
  - **Custom CMC** - Allows you to assign a custom CMC to a card, helping you smooth out the curve and display real mana costs that you will experience in game (e.g. a [Black Sun's Zenith](https://scryfall.com/card/mbs/39/black-suns-zenith) is probably never going to be cast for {B}{B}).
  - **Set deck image** - Sets the art of a certain card as a deck image displayed in the deck folders and as a bacground of the deck overview.
