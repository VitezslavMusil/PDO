# Playtester and Multiplayer

**To acces the Playtester, click on the "Playtester" button on the right side of the Deck Overview**

The Playtester allows the user to playstest the deck againts no one (Called "Goldfishing"). This allows you to feel the porbabilities of drawing certain cards and adjust their ratios.
In the case of more complicated decks like manual Storm, Blink or other decks that generaly "durdle", the Playtester helps to practice the deck and cut the time needed to perform game actions in actual matches.

## How to play with others

While Atchidekt's playtester **has no direct ways to create a session with multiple people, the Popup function can be used to initiate multiplayer through third party software allowing to stream your screen**

The Popup playtester has different characteristics than the full version. Whatever happens in one instance does happen in the other. The Popup instance has always a hidden hand, cards cannot be dragged there and in no almost no options can be adjusted here.
The main function of the Popout is to be streamed to other people allowing you to play with someone else using software such as [Discord](https://discord.com/) or with the combination of [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) and [Spelltable](https://spelltable.wizards.com/).
You as the player will perform the main game actions in the original Playtester instance.
